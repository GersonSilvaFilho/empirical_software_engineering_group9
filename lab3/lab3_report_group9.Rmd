# Simulate the data

## 1) Simulate for a the sample size per group that you defined in the power analysis.

### a) How does your fitted model looks like?

### b) How do it compare with your ‘true’ model you defined in the simulation.

## 2) Simulate for an underpowered study with half the sample size you calculated in the power analysis

### a) How does your fitted model looks like?

### b) How do it compare with your ‘true’ model you defined in the simulation

### c) How do the results change compared to the correctly powered experiment.
